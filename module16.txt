1. RPO is the maximum acceptable data loss, measured in time. RTO is the maximum acceptable time until recovery.

2. use AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy duplicate environments in the same Region.

3. enable cross-Region replication on the bucket and copy existing objects onto themselves

4. store essential data separately from the instance, and develop rapid rebuild processes for compute instances.

5. Amazon Route 53.

6. Most cost-effective, but highest recovery time objective (RTO)

7. Warm standby has a scaled-down version of all infrastructure that scales as necessary and within pre-defined limits to meet the load when a disaster occurs.
Pilot light has minimal infrastructure that always runs. The rest of the infrastructure does not run until a disaster occurs.
